for using Semantic UI ...

You must copy the CDN of Semantic UI {semantic.min.css}
Then past it to index.HTML in public folder.

When we recive the data from server we need to add this data to our store
for that we need to dispatch an action 

So when we pass this product in action it will go to action and return this object and object is taken by reducer 
(for remenber action is an object {
    type : "setProduct",
    payload : product
})
